# Domoticz-Google-Assistant is deprecated and there is no more support for this project!!

### Try out my new dzga here --> [https://github.com/dewgew/dzga-flask](https://github.com/dewgew/dzga-flask)



This is a standalone implementation for [Domoticz Home Automation](https://www.domoticz.com/). It means that you can put this server wherever you want, even on another machine. You need to setup a project in Actions on Google Console. You find instructions below.

Based on Pawcio's script at [Domoticz Forum](https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=27244)

Please feel free to modify it, extend and improve

# Installation
Just open a terminal window and execute this command. Then set up [Actions on Google](https://github.com/DewGew/Domoticz-Google-Assistant/wiki). Thats it!
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DewGew/dzga-installer/master/install.sh)
```
